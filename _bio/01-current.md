I am currently the Applications Team Lead and a Senior Research Scientist at 
[Applied Brain Research](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/), 
a company I co-founded with other members of the 
[Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca) in 2014.
My work focuses on taking our research into low power AI and building it
into products that make those complex methods accessible to non-expert users.
