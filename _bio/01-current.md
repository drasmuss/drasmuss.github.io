I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at [Applied Brain Research](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/), 
a company I co-founded with other members of the 
[Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca) in 2014.  
My research focuses on the integration of deep learning and neuromorphic methods, 
where I apply insights gained from basic research in computer/neuro science to 
develop new applications, both in hardware and software.
