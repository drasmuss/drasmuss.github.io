I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at [Applied Brain Research](https://appliedbrainresearch.com/), a company I co-founded with other members of the [Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca) in 2012.  My research focuses on the areas of deep/hierarchical reinforcement learning, where I apply insights gained from basic research in computer/neuro science to develop new applications, both in hardware and software.
