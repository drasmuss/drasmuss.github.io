I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Botvinick lab](https://botvinicklab.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.  I am working on extending my previous work on hierarchical reinforcement learning into the realm of model-based reasoning, trying to understand how model-based and model-free systems might interact at different levels of the hierarchy.
