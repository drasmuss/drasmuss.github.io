My work is motivated by a general interest in building more flexible, 
adaptive computational systems. This has led to research in a range of 
different areas, including computational neuroscience, (hierarchical) 
reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Now I work to build software
that combines these (and other) approaches, creating products that
translate research advances into real world applications.
