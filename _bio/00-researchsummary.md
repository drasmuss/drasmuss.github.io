My research is motivated by a general interest in building more flexible, 
adaptive computational systems. This has led to work in a range of 
different areas, including computational neuroscience, (hierarchical) 
reinforcement learning, and deep learning. I work to build hybrid systems 
that combine these (and other) approaches, in order to best leverage the 
strengths of each method.
