I work in the field of computational neuroscience, meaning that I use computer 
models to try to understand and recreate the brain's abilities.  I am particularly 
interested in how the brain is able to iteratively improve itself, building upon 
previous skills and knowledge in order to develop an increasingly advanced 
behavioural repertoire.  My approach is to work at the intersection between 
neuroscience and computation; by building detailed neural models 
that integrate new theories from computational fields such as reinforcement 
learning and deep learning, I seek to investigate how those theories might 
inform our understanding of the brain, and vice versa.
