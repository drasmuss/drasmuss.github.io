The Raven's Progressive Matrices intelligence test is one of the most popular tests of general intelligence (the factor quantified by IQ).  It is based on finding the patterns governing a sequence of geometric shapes, and using those patterns to induce the next shape in the sequence.

The idea behind this project was to build a neural model of the brain's inductive, pattern-completion processes, and test that model on the RPM.  The model was able to flexibly find the rules governing novel patterns, and because of its neural implementation it was able to explore the neural basis of general intelligence in humans, such as the changes that occur in aging brains.

This model was also incorporated into the larger SPAUN model, forming the heart of its inductive reasoning ability.
