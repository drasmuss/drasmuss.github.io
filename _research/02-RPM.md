title: Solving Raven's Progressive Matrices in a neural model

The Raven's Progressive Matrices intelligence test is one of the most popular tests of general intelligence (the factor quantified by IQ).  Thus it represents a useful testbed for trying to understand inductive reasoning in the brain.

This project was based on building a neural model of those inductive, pattern-completion processes, and testing that model on the RPM.  This model was able to flexibly find the rules governing novel patterns, and because of its neural implementation it was able to explore the neural basis of general intelligence in humans, such as the changes that occur in aging brains.

This model was also incorporated into the larger SPAUN model, forming the heart of its inductive reasoning ability.
