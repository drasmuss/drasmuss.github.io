Hierarchical reinforcement learning is based on decomposing an overall task (such as making breakfast) into a composition of subtasks (such as making toast, boiling eggs, and so on).  This decomposition has a number of functional benefits, allowing the learning agent to solve more complex and interesting problems.  

My research investigates whether RL processing in the brain could be explained in a similar hierarchical fashion.  This has involved constructing the first neural model to implement the computational theory of HRL, and I continue to work on extending those ideas in new computational directions.
