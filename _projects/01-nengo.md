I am one of the developers of [Nengo](http://www.nengo.ca), a software suite for the construction and simulation of large-scale neural models.  Nengo is designed to aid in the translation between
an algorithmic/mathematical description of a model and a detailed neural implementation.  It provides a simple interface to the user, while flexibly providing more detailed granularity as the modeller requires.

Another key feature of Nengo is that it allows the same model to be run on a range of different computing platforms.  Users can run their model on their home computer, on a GPU cluster, on [neuromorphic hardware](#neuromorphic), or on a BlueGene supercomputer, without any modifications required on their part.
