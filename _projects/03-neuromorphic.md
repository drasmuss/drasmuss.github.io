There are several projects underway around the world aimed at developing neuromorphic computers --  computing platforms specialized in the simulation of large-scale neural models.  These new computing platforms offer many advantages over traditional architectures, such as massive parallelization and low power usage.

One of the key challenges of this new hardware is that its programs must be written in the language of neural networks.  That is where my work comes in: I help to develop neural models to run on these platforms, as well as tools to allow others to do the same (such as [Nengo](#nengo)).
