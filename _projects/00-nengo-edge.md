I am the team lead and primary developer for [NengoEdge](https://edge.nengo.ai), a
cloud-based application for training and deploying audio processing models on low power
edge hardware. NengoEdge exposes powerful configuration options and detailed
metrics to guide users, while being accessible to non-experts.

The idea behind NengoEdge is to take the complex methods we have developed inside 
[ABR](#abr) for training and deploying high accuracy audio models on low power 
hardware, and package them up into an easy-to-use web application. 
This allows companies to build state-of-the-art audio processing into their edge 
applications, without requiring large in-house development teams.
