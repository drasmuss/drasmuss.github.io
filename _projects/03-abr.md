I am a co-founder of [Applied Brain Research, Inc.](http://appliedbrainresearch.com/).  The company was founded in 2014 by a small group of researchers in the [Computational Neuroscience Research Group](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca), and is aimed at producing practical applications based on the ideas developed in that lab.
